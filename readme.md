### Tuts+ Course: SOLID Design Patterns in C#
**Instructor: Derek Jensen**

As software developers, as with most other professions, we can sometimes get bogged down into the specifics of certain projects and find ourselves cutting corners that we know we shouldn't. That being the case, it is important for us to step back every once in a while and resharpen our skills by getting back to the basics. Those basics are exactly what this course is about. In this course, you will be getting back to your C# roots and refreshing your memory on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the SOLID design principles. By the end of this course, I assure you that you will have a renewed vigor to get back into your day to day activities with a better appreciation for what got you to this point in your career and help you to get back to those good programming practices.
